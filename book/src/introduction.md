# Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced Users Guide** for the Cleanroom Testing Framework (clnrm). This guide is designed for developers who want to extend clnrm's capabilities, implement complex testing patterns, and deploy clnrm in production environments.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers four main areas that provide the highest value for advanced users:

### üîå Plugin Development
Learn how to create custom service plugins, integrate with external systems, and extend clnrm's capabilities. This is where you'll get the most value - extending the framework to meet your specific needs.

### üß™ Advanced Testing Patterns
Master multi-service orchestration, chaos engineering, OTEL validation, and performance testing. These patterns enable testing of complex distributed systems.

### üìù Template System Mastery
Deep dive into Tera templates, macro libraries, and variable resolution. Create reusable, maintainable test configurations.

### üöÄ Production Deployment
Deploy clnrm in CI/CD pipelines, optimize performance, and implement enterprise-scale patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this guide, you should have:

- **Basic clnrm knowledge**: Familiarity with `.clnrm.toml` files and basic commands
- **Rust experience**: Understanding of Rust syntax and concepts (for plugin development)
- **Container knowledge**: Basic understanding of Docker/Podman
- **Testing experience**: Familiarity with integration testing concepts

## Core Team Standards

This guide follows FAANG-level quality standards established by the clnrm core team:

### Code Quality Standards
- ‚úÖ **Zero unwrap()/expect()** in production examples
- ‚úÖ **All traits dyn-compatible** for object safety
- ‚úÖ **Proper error handling** with CleanroomError
- ‚úÖ **OTEL instrumentation** in all examples
- ‚úÖ **AAA pattern** in test examples
- ‚úÖ **Descriptive naming** following conventions

### Documentation Standards
- ‚úÖ **Honest documentation** - only features that actually work in v1.0.1
- ‚úÖ **Runnable examples** - every code sample can be executed
- ‚úÖ **Self-testing** - examples are validated by clnrm itself
- ‚úÖ **Verification commands** - clear steps to validate examples

## What Actually Works (v1.0.1)

This guide documents **only** features that are verified to work in clnrm v1.0.1:

### ‚úÖ Fully Working Features
- **Plugin System**: Custom service plugins with container integration
- **Template System**: Tera templates with macro library
- **Container Execution**: Commands run in isolated containers
- **OTEL Integration**: Span creation and basic validation
- **Multi-Service Testing**: Orchestrate multiple services
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions and GitLab CI patterns

### üöß Partially Working Features
- **Advanced OTEL Validation**: Basic span validation works, advanced analysis in progress
- **Chaos Engineering**: Framework exists, advanced patterns being developed
- **Performance Testing**: Basic metrics collection, regression detection in progress

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented
- **AI Features**: Available in experimental `clnrm-ai` crate only
- **Hot Reload**: Planned for future versions
- **Advanced Reporting**: Basic JSON/XML works, advanced formats planned

## How to Use This Guide

### 1. Start with Plugin Development
If you want to extend clnrm, start with the [Plugin Development](plugin-development/README.md) section. This provides the highest value and most practical benefits.

### 2. Learn Advanced Patterns
Once you understand plugins, explore [Advanced Testing Patterns](advanced-patterns/README.md) for complex testing scenarios.

### 3. Master Templates
For reusable configurations, dive into [Template System Mastery](template-mastery/README.md).

### 4. Deploy in Production
Finally, learn [Production Deployment](production-deployment/README.md) strategies for CI/CD and enterprise use.

## Running Examples

Every example in this guide is validated and runnable:

```bash
# Validate all examples
bash tests/mdbook-examples/validate-all-examples.sh

# Run specific examples
cargo test --test mdbook-examples-plugin-development
```
