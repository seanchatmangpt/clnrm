## Integration with Existing Systems

### SurrealDB Integration
- Stores test execution history
- Enables historical pattern analysis
- Persistent baseline tracking

### Ollama AI Integration
- Pattern recognition
- Failure prediction
- Insight generation
- Natural language recommendations

### Telemetry Integration
- OpenTelemetry traces
- Metric export
- Distributed tracing
- Performance monitoring

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: ~1-5% overhead per monitoring cycle
- **Memory**: ~50-100MB for metric buffers
- **Network**: Minimal (webhook calls only)
- **Disk**: Persistent storage via SurrealDB

### Optimization Tips
1. Adjust monitoring interval based on needs
2. Use higher anomaly thresholds to reduce noise
3. Enable proactive healing only in production
4. Configure webhook filtering for critical alerts only

## Troubleshooting

### No Anomalies Detected
- Lower the anomaly threshold (e.g., 0.5)
- Check if baseline has been established (requires 5+ samples)
- Verify metrics are being collected correctly

### Too Many False Positives
- Increase anomaly threshold (e.g., 0.8-0.9)
- Review metric baselines and adjust
- Check for metric collection issues

### Webhook Not Receiving Alerts
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Review webhook server logs
- Test with curl manually

### Self-Healing Not Working
- Ensure `--proactive-healing` flag is enabled
- Check healing engine logs
- Verify anomaly severity is High or Critical
- Review healing history

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Monitoring Only**: Enable detection and alerts first, add healing later
2. **Tune Thresholds**: Start conservative (0.7-0.8) and adjust based on environment
3. **Use Webhooks**: Integrate with existing alerting infrastructure
4. **Monitor the Monitor**: Track monitoring system health and performance
5. **Review Healing Actions**: Periodically review healing history and effectiveness
6. **Baseline Period**: Allow 10-20 monitoring cycles before trusting anomaly detection
7. **Production Readiness**: Test in staging environment first

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning model training for better predictions
- Custom healing action plugins
- Multi-region monitoring support
- Advanced visualization dashboard
- Integration with incident management systems
- Automated root cause analysis
- Predictive capacity planning
