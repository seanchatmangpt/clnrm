# Publication Report: clnrm v1.0.0

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: ❌ **PUBLICATION BLOCKED**
**Mission**: Execute crates.io publication of clnrm v1.0.0

## Summary

**Publication of clnrm v1.0.0 to crates.io was BLOCKED due to working directory containing uncommitted post-v1.0.0 features.**

## Analysis

### Git State

- **Current HEAD**: `15820b0` - "Update Homebrew formula to v1.0.0"
- **v1.0.0 Tag**: `e3d18fe` - "Release v1.0.0 - Production-Ready Foundation"
- **Branch**: `master` (up to date with origin/master)

### Working Directory Issues

The working directory contains **untracked/uncommitted files** that reference incomplete features:

#### Post-v1.0.0 Work in Progress:
1. **`crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/digest.rs`** - Untracked (new feature)
2. **`crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/rng.rs`** - Untracked (new feature)
3. **`crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/time.rs`** - Untracked (new feature)
4. **`crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/common.rs`** - Untracked (new module)

#### Modified Files Referencing Incomplete Features:
- **`crates/clnrm-core/src/lib.rs`** - References `determinism` module that doesn't exist in v1.0.0
- **`crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/mod.rs`** - References `common` and `test_helpers` modules

### Verification Attempt Results

```bash
$ cargo publish -p clnrm-core --dry-run
```

**Result**: ❌ **FAILED** - Missing module files (digest.rs, rng.rs, time.rs)

```
error[E0583]: file not found for module `digest`
error[E0583]: file not found for module `rng`
error[E0583]: file not found for module `time`
```

## Root Cause

The v1.0.0 tag was created **BEFORE** the determinism feature work began. The current working directory has:
- Post-v1.0.0 feature work (determinism module)
- These files are NOT tracked in git
- They are NOT part of the v1.0.0 tagged release
- lib.rs was modified to reference these untracked files

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Publish Clean v1.0.0 (RECOMMENDED)

**Revert uncommitted changes and publish the actual v1.0.0 tagged state:**

```bash
# Stash or discard post-v1.0.0 work
git stash push -m "Post-v1.0.0 determinism feature WIP"

# Remove untracked files
rm -f crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/{digest,rng,time}.rs
rm -f crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/common.rs

# Verify clean state
git status

# Publish clnrm-core
cargo publish -p clnrm-core

# Wait 5 minutes for crates.io indexing
sleep 300

# Publish clnrm binary
cargo publish -p clnrm

# Restore work in progress
git stash pop
```

### Option 2: Release v1.0.1 with Determinism Features

**Complete the determinism feature work and release as v1.0.1:**

```bash
# Complete the determinism feature implementation
# - Finish all tests
# - Update CHANGELOG.md
# - Run full test suite

# Update versions to v1.0.1
# Cargo.toml files

# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add determinism support for reproducible testing"

# Tag v1.0.1
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1 - Determinism Support"

# Publish to crates.io
cargo publish -p clnrm-core
# (wait 5 min)
cargo publish -p clnrm

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master --tags
```

### Option 3: Complete v1.0.0 Work and Re-tag

**If determinism was intended for v1.0.0:**

```bash
# Complete determinism implementation
# Run full test suite
# Update docs

# Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete v1.0.0 determinism features"

# Delete and re-create v1.0.0 tag
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - Production-Ready Foundation with Determinism"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Publish to crates.io
cargo publish -p clnrm-core
# (wait 5 min)
cargo publish -p clnrm

The TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently. If you're working on tasks that would benefit from tracking progress, consider using the TodoWrite tool to track progress. Also consider cleaning up the todo list if has become stale and no longer matches what you are working on. Only use it if it's relevant to the current work. This is just a gentle reminder - ignore if not applicable.


Here are the existing contents of your todo list:

[1. [in_progress] Publish clnrm-core to crates.io with --allow-dirty
2. [pending] Wait 5 minutes for crates.io indexing
3. [pending] Publish clnrm binary to crates.io
4. [pending] Verify publication at crates.io
5. [pending] Test installation with cargo install
6. [pending] Generate publication report]
</system-reminder>```

## Critical Decision Needed

**USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Which option should I proceed with?

1. **Option 1 (RECOMMENDED)**: Publish clean v1.0.0, save determinism work for v1.0.1
2. **Option 2**: Complete determinism work and release as v1.0.1
3. **Option 3**: Complete determinism work and include in v1.0.0 (re-tag)

## Files Affected

### Modified (will be reverted for Option 1):
- `crates/clnrm-core/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/mod.rs`

### Untracked (will be removed for Option 1):
- `crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/digest.rs`
- `crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/rng.rs`
- `crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/time.rs`
- `crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/common.rs`
- `docs/V1.0.0_FINAL_VALIDATION.md`

## Version Information

### Current Versions in Cargo.toml
```toml
[workspace.package]
version = "1.0.0"
```

### Crates to Publish
1. **clnrm-core** v1.0.0 - Core library (must publish first)
2. **clnrm** v1.0.0 - CLI binary (depends on clnrm-core 1.0.0)

## Repository State

```bash
$ git tag -l "v1.0*"
v1.0.0

$ git describe --tags
v1.0.0-1-g15820b0

$ git status --short
M  .claude-flow/metrics/system-metrics.json
M  crates/clnrm-core/src/lib.rs
M  crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/mod.rs
?? crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/digest.rs
?? crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/rng.rs
?? crates/clnrm-core/src/determinism/time.rs
?? crates/clnrm-core/src/validation/common.rs
?? docs/V1.0.0_FINAL_VALIDATION.md
```

## Conclusion

**Publication is BLOCKED** until working directory is cleaned or features are completed.

**Recommended Action**: Execute Option 1 (publish clean v1.0.0, save determinism for v1.0.1).
