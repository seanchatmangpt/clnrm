# Tests To Be Done - Work Completion Validation

A meta-testing framework for validating that claimed features, functionality, and deliverables actually exist and work as documented. Higher-level abstraction than BDD - focused on **work validation** rather than behavior testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

**"Tests to be done"** is not about testing code functionality. It's about validating that work is actually completed and deliverables exist as claimed.

### **Core Distinction**
- **Unit Tests** â†’ Test individual functions work
- **Integration Tests** â†’ Test components interact correctly
- **BDD Tests** â†’ Test behaviors are implemented
- **Property Tests** â†’ Test mathematical properties hold
- **Fuzz Tests** â†’ Test robustness with random inputs
- **Tests To Be Done** â†’ **Test that work is actually completed**

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Differences from Traditional Testing

| Aspect | Traditional Testing | Tests To Be Done |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Code functionality | Work completion |
| **Level** | Implementation details | Deliverable validation |
| **Goal** | Bug detection | Claim verification |
| **Scope** | Code behavior | Feature existence |
| **Validation** | Test execution | Evidence collection |
| **Success** | Tests pass | Claims verified |

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

### **Core Validation Patterns**
- [ ] **Claim Extraction** - Automated extraction of feature claims from documentation
- [ ] **Evidence Collection** - Systematic gathering of proof that features work
- [ ] **Validation Execution** - Automated testing of claimed functionality
- [ ] **Gap Analysis** - Identification of claim vs. reality discrepancies
- [ ] **Reporting** - Comprehensive validation reports and metrics

### **Validation Infrastructure**
- [ ] **Automated Validation Pipeline** - CI/CD integration for work validation
- [ ] **Evidence Repository** - Centralized storage of validation evidence
- [ ] **Validation Dashboard** - Real-time validation status and metrics
- [ ] **False Positive Detection** - Automated identification of unsubstantiated claims
- [ ] **Regression Monitoring** - Detection of work completion regressions

## ðŸš€ Success Metrics

### **Work Validation Quality**
