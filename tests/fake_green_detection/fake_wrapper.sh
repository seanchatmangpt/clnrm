# What this script does NOT do (and clnrm will detect):
# - Does not create OTEL spans
# - Does not launch containers (no container.start events)
# - Does not create parent-child span relationships
# - Does not emit lifecycle events (container.exec, container.stop)
# - Does not produce hermetic resource attributes
# - Does not respect temporal ordering constraints
# - Does not satisfy span count requirements
# - Does not produce a verifiable trace digest
