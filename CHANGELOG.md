### Migration Notes

#### Breaking Changes
- Service plugins now require health prediction implementation
- Marketplace commands added to CLI (new dependency on plugin registry)
- AI commands require Ollama service running locally (default: `http://localhost:11434`)

#### New Requirements
- **Ollama**: Must be installed and running for AI features
  ```bash
  # Install Ollama
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

  # Pull recommended model
  ollama pull llama3.2:3b
  ```
- **SurrealDB**: Required for AI intelligence service (automatically managed by framework)

#### Upgrade Steps
1. Update Cargo.toml to version 0.4.0
2. Install Ollama for AI features: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
3. Review new CLI commands: `clnrm --help`
4. Configure monitoring: `clnrm ai-monitor --help`
5. Explore marketplace: `clnrm marketplace search`

#### Configuration Changes
- Auto-scaling configs now support predictive parameters
- Monitoring thresholds configurable via CLI flags
- Webhook URLs supported for external alert integration

### Known Issues
- Ollama service must be running for AI commands (not auto-started)
- Marketplace registry endpoints are placeholders (requires production deployment)
- Some AI insights may require fine-tuning for specific test patterns

### Deprecations
- None in this release
