# v0.7.0 DX Features Architecture - Summary

## Overview

This directory contains the complete architectural design for Cleanroom Testing Framework v0.7.0 Developer Experience (DX) features. The design focuses on five major components that work together to provide rapid feedback loops and production-grade performance.

## Design Documents

### 01. File Watcher Architecture
**File:** `01-file-watcher-architecture.md`

Cross-platform file system monitoring with the `notify` crate, providing automatic test execution on template file changes.

**Key Features:**
- 300ms debouncing to prevent event storms
- Pattern-based filtering (*.clnrm.toml.tera)
- Automatic pipeline triggering (Render → Validate → Execute → Analyze)
- Configurable ignore patterns

**Performance:** < 100ms reaction time from file change to pipeline start

---

### 02. Change Detection Architecture
**File:** `02-change-detection-architecture.md`

Hash-based change detection system that skips test execution when rendered TOML output hasn't changed.

**Key Features:**
- SHA-256 hashing of rendered templates
- Variable context tracking (detect variable changes)
- Persistent cache (.clnrm/cache/hashes.json)
- Incremental validation support

**Performance:** 4x-20x speedup through cache hits

---

### 03. Dry-Run Validator Architecture
**File:** `03-dry-run-validator-architecture.md`

Fast TOML structure validation without starting containers, enabling rapid feedback during development.

**Key Features:**
- Tera template syntax validation
- TOML parsing with line/column errors
- v0.6.0 schema validation (required sections, field types, value ranges)
- Service reference validation

**Performance:** < 50ms validation time per template

---

### 04. Parallel Executor Architecture
**File:** `04-parallel-executor-architecture.md`

Worker pool-based parallel executor for running multiple test scenarios concurrently with resource limits.

**Key Features:**
- Priority-based scenario queue
- Configurable worker pool (auto-scales to CPU count)
- Per-container memory and CPU limits
- Concurrent OTEL span collection
- Container pooling for 15x speedup

**Performance:** Linear scaling to 8 workers, 2.8-4.4x speedup

---

### 05. Diff Engine Architecture
**File:** `05-diff-engine-architecture.md`

OTEL trace comparison engine that highlights missing/extra spans, attribute changes, and structural differences.

**Key Features:**
- Baseline trace loading and caching
- Hierarchical span tree building
- Attribute and structure comparison
- ASCII tree visualization with color-coded diffs (✓ ✏️  ➕ ❌)

**Performance:** < 100ms diff generation for typical traces

---

### 06. Component Diagrams
**File:** `06-component-diagrams.md`

Visual diagrams showing component interactions, data flow, and system architecture.

**Includes:**
- System overview diagram
- Internal component structures
- Event flow diagrams
- Integration pipeline
- Concurrency model
- Bottleneck analysis

---

### 07. Module Structure
**File:** `07-module-structure.md`

Complete module organization, API contracts, and coding standards.

**Includes:**
- Directory structure
- Public API definitions for all modules
- Error handling contracts (no unwrap/expect)
- Async/sync guidelines (trait compatibility)
- Testing contracts (AAA pattern)
- Documentation requirements

---

### 08. Performance Analysis
**File:** `08-performance-analysis.md`

Comprehensive performance analysis, benchmarking strategy, and optimization roadmap.

**Includes:**
- Performance targets for each component
- Bottleneck identification
- Complexity analysis (time/space)
- Memory budgets
- Benchmarking strategy
- Performance monitoring metrics

---

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Production Quality
- **No false positives**: Use `unimplemented!()` for incomplete features
- **Error handling**: All functions return `Result<T, CleanroomError>`
- **No panics**: Never use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` in production code
- **Dyn compatibility**: Trait methods are sync (no async in traits)

### 2. Performance First
- **Fast feedback**: < 6s from file save to results
- **Efficient caching**: 80%+ cache hit rate
- **Bounded resources**: < 9GB memory for typical workloads
- **Scalable execution**: Linear scaling to 8 workers

### 3. Developer Experience
- **Automatic execution**: File watcher triggers tests on save
- **Rapid validation**: Dry-run validation without container overhead
- **Smart caching**: Skip unchanged tests automatically
- **Clear diagnostics**: Validation errors with line/column numbers

### 4. Observability
- **OTEL integration**: Concurrent span collection
- **Trace comparison**: Detect observability regressions
- **Performance metrics**: Track reaction times, throughput
- **Structured logging**: All components use tracing macros

Time per iteration: 40s
```

**After v0.7.0:**
```
Automatic workflow: Edit → Save → (auto-execute with cache)
Time per iteration: 1s
