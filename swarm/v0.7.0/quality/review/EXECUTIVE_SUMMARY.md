```

**Minimal Implementation:**
```rust
// watch.rs
pub struct WatchConfig { /* fields from dev.rs */ }
pub async fn watch_and_run(_config: WatchConfig) -> crate::error::Result<()> {
    unimplemented!("watch_and_run: to be implemented")
}

// cache.rs
pub struct Cache;
pub struct CacheManager;
pub struct FileCache;
pub struct MemoryCache;
// Stub implementations

// v0_7_0/mod.rs
pub mod dev;
pub mod diff { pub fn diff_traces() { unimplemented!() } }
pub mod dry_run { pub fn dry_run_validate() { unimplemented!() } }
pub mod fmt { pub fn format_files() { unimplemented!() } }
pub mod lint { pub fn lint_files() { unimplemented!() } }
```

           Self::new().unwrap_or_else(|e| {
               panic!("Failed to create default TemplateRenderer: {}", e)
           })
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Run formatter**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   ```

3. **Fix clippy warnings**

## Recommendations

### For Project Manager

1. **Allocate 4 weeks for v0.7.0 completion**
   - Week 1: Build restoration + standards compliance
   - Week 2: Core feature implementation
   - Weeks 3-4: Refactoring + testing

2. **Prioritize working software over perfect code**
   - Get build working first
   - Add features incrementally
   - Refactor continuously

3. **Set realistic expectations**
   - Hot reload will work but may exceed 3s for complex tests initially
   - File size limits are aspirational, achieve gradually
   - Performance will improve with container reuse

---

### For Development Team

1. **Follow the priority order strictly**
   - Don't implement new features until build works
   - Don't refactor until features are complete
   - Don't optimize prematurely

2. **Maintain test coverage**
   - Write tests for every new feature
   - Update tests during refactoring
   - Run tests before every commit

3. **Use automation**
   - Pre-commit hooks for fmt/clippy
   - CI for regression detection
   - Automated performance benchmarks

---

### For Architecture

1. **Implement caching at all levels**
   - Template caching (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Config caching (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Container pool (CRITICAL for performance)

2. **Design for incremental improvements**
   - Module structure supports future splitting
   - Cache interfaces allow swapping implementations
   - Performance knobs exposed to users

3. **Monitor and iterate**
   - Add instrumentation early
   - Collect real-world metrics
   - Adjust based on data

---

## Conclusion
