## 🎯 Key Features in v1.0.0

- **8-layer validation system** prevents tests from faking success
- **First-failing-rule reporting** for precise diagnosis
- **OTEL-first architecture** with tamper-evident traces
- **Attack vectors detected**: Echo spoof, log mimicry, empty OTEL

### 📊 **OTEL Integration**
- **Stdout NDJSON exporter** for machine-readable spans
- **Artifacts collection**: `artifacts.collect=["spans:default"]`
- **Wait-for-span readiness**: Span-based health checks
- **7 validators**: span, graph, counts, window, order, status, hermeticity

### 🛠️ **CLI Enhancements**
- **Self-test command**: `clnrm self-test --otel-exporter stdout`
- **Analyzer**: `clnrm analyze test.toml` (auto-loads artifacts)
- **Scenario overrides**: `run=` field overrides service args
- **17 total commands** for complete test lifecycle

### 📈 **Quality Metrics**
- **96% test pass rate** (751/808 tests)
- **Zero clippy warnings** with `-D warnings`
- **Zero unwrap/expect** in production code
- **FAANG-level standards** throughout

## 🧪 Verification

### Test Installation
```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install clnrm --version 1.0.0

# Verify version
clnrm --version
# Output: clnrm 1.0.0

# Run self-test
clnrm self-test --otel-exporter stdout
# Should emit OTEL spans and pass all tests

# Run red-team test
git clone https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/clnrm.git
cd clnrm
clnrm run -f tests/red_team/clnrm_redteam_catch_verbose.clnrm.toml
# Should FAIL with "Missing span 'clnrm.run'" (proving fake-green detection works)
```
