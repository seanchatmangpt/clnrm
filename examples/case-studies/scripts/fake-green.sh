# Fake-Green Test Implementation
#
# This script PRETENDS to run tests but actually does nothing.
# It echoes "Passed" and exits 0 WITHOUT launching containers or generating spans.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
# - Echoes success message
# - Exits with code 0
# - NO containers launched
# - NO OTEL spans generated
# - NO lifecycle events
# - NO parent→child relationships
# - NO hermetic attributes
#
# TRADITIONAL ASSERTION-BASED TESTING: Would PASS this (exit code 0)
# OTEL-FIRST VALIDATION: Will FAIL (missing all evidence)
#
# EXPECTED: FAIL on ALL detection layers:
# 1. Missing lifecycle events (container.start, exec, stop)
# 2. Missing parent→child edge (clnrm.run → step)
# 3. Zero spans (expected ≥2)
# 4. No ordering (plugin.registry → step)
# 5. Empty window (no containment)
# 6. No status to check
# 7. No hermetic attributes

# Echo success WITHOUT actually running anything
echo "Passed"
echo "✅ All tests passed (FAKE!)"
echo

# Exit successfully WITHOUT having done any real work
# Traditional assertion-based testing would PASS this
# because it only checks exit code, not actual execution
exit 0

# WHAT'S MISSING:
# - No clnrm execution
# - No container creation
# - No OTEL span generation
# - No lifecycle events
# - No span hierarchy
# - No hermetic validation
# - No actual test execution
#
# This is a "fake-green" test - it reports success without doing the work.
# OTEL-first validation will catch this because ALL evidence is missing.
