## How to Measure

### Automatic Measurement (Built-in)

#### Client-Side Tracking
All engagement events are automatically tracked in the browser:

```typescript
// Session start (auto-tracked on page load)
useEffect(() => {
  const variant = getABVariant();
  setAbVariant(variant);
  trackEvent("session_start", { mode: "child", variant });
}, []);

// Message sent (auto-tracked on submit)
trackEvent("message_sent", {
  mode: "child",
  message_length: input.length
});

// Virtue detected (auto-tracked by AI response)
if (virtueHeader) {
  setVirtue(virtueHeader);
  trackVirtue(virtueHeader, userMessage.content);
}

// Reward view (auto-tracked when reward appears)
if (rewardHeader && virtueHeader) {
  trackRewardView(virtueHeader, abVariant);
}

// Premium view (auto-tracked when CTA shown)
if (premiumTitle && premiumLink) {
  trackPremiumView(abVariant);
}

// Premium click (tracked on button click)
const handlePremiumClick = () => {
  trackPremiumClick(abVariant);
};
```

#### Server-Side Calculation
All analytics are calculated in real-time:

```typescript
// GET /api/metrics endpoint
export async function GET() {
  const metrics = getMetrics();
  return Response.json(metrics);
}

// getMetrics() in src/lib/telemetry.ts
export function getMetrics(): MetricsData {
  // Sessions
  const sessions = events.filter(e => e.event === "session_start").length;

  // Messages
  const messages = events.filter(e => e.event === "message_sent").length;

  // Virtues
  const virtues = events.filter(e => e.event === "virtue_detected").length;

  // Rewards
  const rewardViews = events.filter(e => e.event === "reward_view").length;
  const rewardClicks = events.filter(e => e.event === "reward_click").length;

  // Premium
  const premiumViews = events.filter(e => e.event === "premium_view").length;
  const premiumClicks = events.filter(e => e.event === "premium_click").length;

  // A/B by variant
  const viewsA = events.filter(e =>
    e.event === "premium_view" && e.payload.variant === "A"
  ).length;

  // Calculate CTRs
  const ctrA = (viewsA > 0) ? (clicksA / viewsA) * 100 : 0;

  // ... return all metrics
}
```

    WHEN session_date = first_session + INTERVAL '7 days'
    THEN user_id
  END) AS d7_retained,
  (d7_retained::FLOAT / cohort_size) * 100 AS d7_retention_rate
FROM user_sessions
GROUP BY cohort_date
ORDER BY cohort_date DESC;

-- Virtue distribution by time of day
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) AS hour,
  payload->>'virtue' AS virtue,

### Funnel Drop-Off Analysis

#### Healthy Funnel Benchmarks

| Stage | Expected Conversion | Current | Status |
|-------|---------------------|---------|--------|
| Sessions → Messages | 80-90% | 84.4% | ✅ Healthy |
| Messages → Virtues | 70-85% | 84.2% | ✅ Healthy |
| Virtues → Rewards | 85-95% | 89.1% | ✅ Healthy |
| Rewards → Premium Views | 75-85% | 82.5% | ✅ Healthy |
| Premium Views → Clicks | 8-12% | 7.2% | ⚠️ Near Target |

**Overall:** Sessions → Premium Clicks = 3.8%
**Target:** ≥5%
**Gap:** Need 1.2% improvement

#### Where Users Drop Off

**Biggest Drop-Off:** Premium Views → Premium Clicks (92.8% don't click)
- **Why?** This is expected - premium requires payment decision
- **Normal:** 7-10% is typical for paid conversion
- **Opportunity:** Improve CTA copy, add social proof, offer trial

**Secondary Drop-Off:** Sessions → Messages (15.6% don't engage)
- **Why?** Some users are browsing, not ready to interact
- **Normal:** 10-20% is typical for exploratory visits
- **Opportunity:** Add engaging prompts, example achievements, video intro

#### Red Flags to Watch For

**Major Drop-Offs (>30% at any stage):**
- Indicates UX issue, technical bug, or unclear value prop
- Requires immediate investigation

**Inverse Funnel (later stages higher than earlier):**
- Indicates tracking error or data quality issue
- Check event tracking implementation

**Zero Drop-Off (100% conversion between stages):**
- Indicates tracking error (events firing incorrectly)
- Verify event tracking logic

### A/B Testing Best Practices

#### What to Test

**High-Impact Tests:**
1. **Premium CTA Copy** (current focus)
   - Headlines
   - Button text
   - Value propositions

2. **CTA Placement**
   - After reward vs after 2 virtues vs sticky footer
   - Top of page vs inline vs popup

3. **Pricing & Offers**
   - Monthly vs annual vs lifetime
   - $4.99 vs $7.99 vs $9.99
   - Free trial (yes/no, 7 days vs 30 days)

4. **Virtue Reward System**
   - Video rewards vs badge collection vs points
   - Immediate reward vs delayed gratification

5. **AI Response Style**
   - Formal vs casual
   - Short vs detailed
   - Action-oriented vs reflective

#### Testing Framework

**1. Hypothesis Formation**
```
Hypothesis: Showing the premium CTA after users earn 2+ virtues
(instead of just 1) will increase CTR by 15% because users will
have more trust and engagement.

Baseline: 7.2% CTR
Target: 8.3% CTR (+1.1pp)
Test Duration: 2 weeks
Sample Size Needed: 200 clicks minimum
```

**2. Variant Design**
- Control (A): Current behavior (CTA after 1 virtue)
- Treatment (B): New behavior (CTA after 2 virtues)

**3. Success Metrics**
- Primary: Premium CTR
- Secondary: Premium clicks (absolute count)
- Guardrail: Session-to-virtue rate (ensure B doesn't reduce this)

**4. Analysis Plan**
```python
# Chi-square test for significance
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Data: [clicks, non-clicks]
variant_a = [10, 115]  # 10 clicks / 125 views
variant_b = [7, 103]   # 7 clicks / 110 views

chi2, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency([variant_a, variant_b])

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Statistically significant!")
else:
    print("Not significant, continue testing")
```

**5. Rollout Plan**
- If B wins: Gradual rollout (50% → 75% → 100% over 1 week)
- Monitor for regressions
- Keep A running for 10% of traffic as control
- Document learnings for future tests

### Custom Analytics

#### SQL Queries for Deep Analysis

**Revenue by Cohort:**
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('week', first_session) AS cohort_week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users,
  SUM(CASE WHEN days_since_signup <= 7 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS week_1_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN days_since_signup <= 30 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS month_1_revenue,
  SUM(revenue) AS lifetime_revenue
FROM user_revenue
GROUP BY cohort_week
ORDER BY cohort_week DESC;
```

**Virtue Progression Analysis:**
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  MIN(timestamp) AS first_virtue,
  MAX(timestamp) AS latest_virtue,
  COUNT(*) AS total_virtues,
  COUNT(DISTINCT virtue) AS unique_virtues,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT virtue, ', ') AS virtues_earned
FROM virtue_history
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5  -- Power users with 5+ virtues
ORDER BY total_virtues DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Session Depth Analysis:**
```sql
SELECT
  session_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'message_sent' THEN 1 END) AS messages,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'virtue_detected' THEN 1 END) AS virtues,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'reward_click' THEN 1 END) AS reward_clicks,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event = 'premium_click' THEN 1 END) AS premium_clicks,
  MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS session_duration_ms
FROM telemetry_events
GROUP BY session_id
ORDER BY messages DESC;
```

**A/B Test Segmentation:**
```sql
SELECT
  payload->>'variant' AS variant,
  payload->>'virtue' AS virtue_type,
  COUNT(*) AS premium_clicks,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS pct_of_total
FROM telemetry_events
WHERE event = 'premium_click'
GROUP BY variant, virtue_type
ORDER BY variant, premium_clicks DESC;
```
