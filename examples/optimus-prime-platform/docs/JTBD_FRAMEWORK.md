## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing Coverage
**Target**: ≥90% code coverage for critical paths

**Priority Areas**:
1. **Virtue Detection Logic** (JTBD-001)
   - Test all 6 virtues (Teamwork, Wisdom, Courage, Compassion, Justice, Hope)
   - Edge cases: ambiguous input, multiple virtues, no virtue detected
   - Performance: <50ms processing time

2. **Statistical Calculations** (JTBD-008, JTBD-019)
   - A/B test significance (t-test, chi-square)
   - Confidence intervals (80%, 95%)
   - Sample size validation

3. **Telemetry Event Tracking** (JTBD-001, JTBD-002, JTBD-003)
   - Event serialization/deserialization
   - Data integrity validation
   - Performance: <10ms per event

**Priority Flows**:
1. **Child Achievement Flow** (JTBD-001 → JTBD-002 → JTBD-003)
   - User submits achievement
   - AI responds with virtue recognition
   - Reward button displayed and clicked
   - Premium CTA shown and tracked
   - All events logged in telemetry

2. **Executive KPI Query Flow** (JTBD-006)

   - AI parses query and retrieves metrics
   - Response formatted and returned
   - Query logged in telemetry

3. **A/B Test Flow** (JTBD-019)
   - User assigned to variant (client-side)
   - Premium CTA shown with variant copy
   - Click tracked with variant ID

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Child Chat Load Test**
   - 100 concurrent users
   - 10 messages per session
   - Target: ≤2.5s P95 response time

2. **Executive Query Load Test**
   - 50 concurrent executives

2. **Parents (n=15)**: Safety, value, trust
3. **Executives (n=10)**: Utility, accuracy, speed
4. **Educators (n=10)**: Effectiveness, usability, outcomes

### Compliance Testing

## Appendix: JTBD Methodology

### Framework Principles
1. **Focus on the "why" not the "what"**: Understand user motivations, not just features
2. **Situational context**: "When [situation]" defines the triggering moment
3. **Desired outcome**: "So I can [outcome]" defines success
4. **Testable criteria**: Every JTBD must have measurable acceptance criteria

### JTBD vs User Stories
- **JTBD**: Higher-level, outcome-focused, persona-agnostic (can apply to multiple personas)
- **User Story**: Specific, implementation-focused, persona-specific

### Success Metrics Framework
1. **Leading Indicators**: Predict future outcomes (engagement, usage frequency)
2. **Lagging Indicators**: Measure final outcomes (revenue, retention)
3. **Balanced Scorecard**: Combine user satisfaction, business value, operational efficiency

### Continuous Improvement
- **Quarterly JTBD Review**: Validate assumptions, update metrics
- **User Research**: Conduct interviews (n=10 per persona per quarter)
- **A/B Testing**: Continuously optimize based on data
- **Feedback Loops**: Integrate user feedback into JTBD refinement
