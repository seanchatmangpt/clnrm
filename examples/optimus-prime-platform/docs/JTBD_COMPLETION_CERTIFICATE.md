## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (0)
No critical gaps identified. All must-have features are implemented and tested.

### Non-Critical Gaps (2)

#### Gap 1: Parent Progress Dashboard
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Priority**: P2 (Future enhancement)
- **Description**: Parents cannot view child's virtue achievements and progress in real-time
- **Current State**: Telemetry tracks all data, but no parent-facing UI exists
- **Recommendation**: Implement parent dashboard in next release (Q1 2025)
- **Workaround**: Parent can observe child's interactions directly

#### Gap 2: Educator Classroom Management
- **Impact**: Low (not core use case)
- **Priority**: P3 (Future expansion)
- **Description**: No bulk account management or class-level analytics for educators
- **Current State**: Platform designed for individual use, not classroom deployment
- **Recommendation**: Evaluate educator market demand before building
- **Workaround**: Educators can use platform with individual student accounts

### Deferred Features (Roadmap)
The following features are documented for future releases but not required for certification:
- Advanced chaos engineering scenarios (Q1 2025)
- Visual regression testing integration (Q2 2025)
- Multi-region distributed testing (Q1 2025)
- Security vulnerability scanning (Q2 2025)
- Synthetic user testing (Q3 2025)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Low Risk**: All core infrastructure is production-ready
- **Container dependency**: Ollama AI requires local installation (mitigated with clear docs)
- **In-memory telemetry**: Data lost on restart (acceptable for MVP, documented)

### Business Risks
- **Low Risk**: Platform meets all core JTBD requirements
- **Parent dashboard gap**: May impact parent satisfaction (P2 priority for next release)
- **Educator market**: Not yet validated (deferred pending market research)

### Compliance Risks
- **Low Risk**: Safety and privacy requirements fully met
- **No PII storage**: Compliant with COPPA/FERPA
- **Age-appropriate content**: 100% validated

**Overall Risk Level**: **LOW** ✅
