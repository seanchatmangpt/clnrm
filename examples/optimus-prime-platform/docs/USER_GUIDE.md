## Troubleshooting

### Technical Issues

**Problem: Chat not responding**
- **Check:** Is Ollama running? The AI needs the local Ollama service
- **Solution:** Restart Ollama with `ollama serve`
- **Verify:** Make sure qwen3-coder:30b model is installed

**Problem: Slow responses (> 5 seconds)**
- **Cause:** Large language model processing time
- **Normal:** 2-3 seconds is typical for AI responses
- **If slower:** Check system resources, restart Ollama

**Problem: No virtue badge appearing**
- **Check:** Did your message include virtue keywords?
- **Keywords needed:**
  - Teamwork: team, group, together, help, cooperate
  - Wisdom: learn, study, school, knowledge, understand
  - Compassion: help, care, kind, friend, support
  - Courage: brave, challenge, difficult, try, overcome
- **Default:** If no keywords match, you'll get "courage" badge

**Problem: Can't access dashboard**
- **URL:** Make sure you're going to `/admin/dashboard`
- **Permissions:** Dashboard is available to all users in this demo
- **Loading:** Wait for 3-second initial load time

**Problem: A/B test metrics showing 0%**
- **Cause:** Not enough data collected yet
- **Solution:** Use the platform more to generate events
- **Note:** Both variants need views to calculate CTR

### Usage Issues

**Problem: Optimus Prime's responses don't make sense**
- **AI Limitation:** Language models can sometimes generate unclear text
- **Solution:** Try rephrasing your message
- **Tip:** Be more specific and detailed in your description

**Problem: Same response every time**
- **Not a bug:** Optimus Prime uses AI, so responses may be similar for similar inputs
- **Variety:** Try describing different types of achievements
- **Note:** The AI should still provide unique responses each time

**Problem: Reward links don't work**
- **Expected:** These are example URLs in the demo
- **Purpose:** In production, these would link to actual video content
- **Alternative:** Acknowledge the virtue badge as the real reward

**Problem: Executive queries return generic answers**
- **AI Behavior:** The AI interprets your question and generates responses
- **Improvement:** Ask more specific questions with exact metrics
- **Data:** Ensure you have tracking data by using child mode first

### Account & Access Issues

**Problem: Can't find login page**
- **Note:** This demo doesn't require authentication
- **Access:** Navigate directly to `/child`, `/executive`, or `/admin/dashboard`
- **Production:** Full version would include user accounts

**Problem: Lost progress/history**
- **Expected:** This demo uses in-memory storage
- **Persistence:** Data resets when server restarts
- **Production:** Full version would use database storage

### Getting Help

**For Technical Support:**
- Check the GitHub repository for known issues
- Review the installation guide in README.md
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed (Node.js 18+, Ollama)
- Check console logs for error messages

**For Usage Questions:**
- Re-read the relevant section of this guide

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is this platform safe for children?**
A: Yes! The platform uses positive, encouraging language and focuses on leadership development. It includes no violent or inappropriate content. However, parental supervision is recommended, especially for younger children (8-10 years old).

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**
A: In this demo version, no account is required. Simply navigate to the appropriate mode (/child, /executive, or /admin/dashboard). A production version would include user accounts for personalized tracking.

**Q: How does the AI work?**
A: The platform uses Ollama with the qwen3-coder:30b language model running locally. This AI processes your messages and generates contextually appropriate responses based on leadership and virtue themes.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: In this demo, data is stored temporarily in memory and resets when the server restarts. No personal information is permanently stored or shared. A production version would include robust privacy protections.

### For Children

**Q: Why didn't I get the virtue badge I expected?**
A: The system looks for specific keywords in your message. Try using words like "team" for teamwork, "brave" for courage, "learn" for wisdom, or "help" for compassion. Be descriptive!

**Q: Can I earn multiple virtue badges at once?**
A: The system recognizes one virtue per message based on the first matching keywords. Try sharing different achievements to earn different badges!

**Q: What are the reward videos?**
A: In this demo, reward links are examples. In a full version, you'd watch short educational videos about the virtue you demonstrated, featuring more stories from Optimus Prime.

**Q: Can I talk to my friends on this platform?**
A: No, this is a one-on-one experience between you and Optimus Prime. It's designed for personal reflection and growth, not social networking.

### For Parents

**Q: How much does premium cost?**
A: Premium pricing would be determined by the production version. This demo shows the premium offer mechanism but doesn't include actual payment processing.

**Q: Can I see my child's conversation history?**
A: In this demo, conversations aren't saved. A production version could include parent dashboards with usage summaries (not full transcripts) to respect child privacy while enabling monitoring.

**Q: How much time should my child spend on this?**
A: We recommend 15-30 minutes per day. The platform is designed for quality reflection, not extended sessions. Use it as one tool among many for character development.

**Q: What age range is this appropriate for?**
A: The platform is designed for ages 8-13. Younger children (8-10) should use with direct parental supervision. Older children (11-13) can use more independently with periodic check-ins.

### For Executives

**Q: How often does the dashboard update?**
A: The dashboard auto-refreshes every 3 seconds with the latest data from the in-memory telemetry system.

**Q: Can I export analytics data?**
A: The current demo doesn't include export functionality. A production version would offer CSV/Excel exports, API access, and integration with business intelligence tools.

**Q: How accurate are the revenue projections?**
A: The current system shows mock revenue data for demonstration purposes. A production version would integrate with actual payment systems for accurate financial reporting.

**Q: Can I customize the KPI targets?**
A: The demo uses fixed targets (8% premium CTR, $250K monthly revenue, 95% D7 retention). A production version would allow customizable OKRs and targets.

### For Educators

**Q: Is this platform COPPA compliant?**
A: This demo is designed with child safety in mind. A production version for schools would include full COPPA compliance, FERPA alignment, and appropriate data protection measures.

**Q: Can I use this with students under 8 years old?**
A: The content is calibrated for ages 8-13. For younger students, consider adapted usage with teacher mediation and simplified discussions.

**Q: How do I track multiple students?**
A: The demo doesn't include class management features. A production version would offer teacher dashboards, student rosters, progress tracking, and class-level analytics.

**Q: Can I customize the virtues for my curriculum?**
A: The current system focuses on four core virtues (teamwork, wisdom, compassion, courage). A production version could allow customization to align with specific school values or curriculum standards.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need Ollama installed?**
A: Ollama runs the AI language model locally on your computer, ensuring fast responses without cloud dependencies. This also keeps data private and local.

**Q: Can I use this without internet?**
A: Once set up, the platform runs entirely locally and doesn't require internet after the initial installation and model download.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**
A: Minimum: Node.js 18+, 16GB RAM, modern CPU. Recommended: 32GB RAM for better AI performance. The qwen3-coder:30b model is large (30.5 billion parameters).

**Q: Can I deploy this to production?**
A: This is a demo/proof-of-concept. For production deployment, you'd need to add: user authentication, database persistence, payment processing, enhanced security, and scalability improvements.
