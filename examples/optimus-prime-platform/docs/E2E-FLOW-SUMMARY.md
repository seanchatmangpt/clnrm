# End-to-End Flow: Optimus Prime Platform with Vision AI

## üéØ Overview

Complete implementation of the Optimus Prime educational platform with:
- **AI-powered conversations** between children and Optimus Prime
- **Report card generation** from conversation history
- **Vision AI analysis** of uploaded report card images
- **Chain-of-thought evaluation** with detailed reasoning
- **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** for full observability

## üîÑ Complete User Flow

### 1. Child Conversation (http://localhost:3000/child)
- Child chats with Optimus Prime about their day
- Optimus detects character virtues (teamwork, courage, honesty, compassion, wisdom)
- Full conversation context maintained
- **OpenTelemetry Traces**: `chat_message`, `virtue_detected`

### 2. Report Card Generation (http://localhost:3000/report-card)
- Parents request report card based on conversation history
- AI generates structured report using `streamObject()`
- Includes:
  - Overall score (0-100)
  - Virtue assessments with scores and feedback
  - Achievements and badges
  - Areas of strength and growth
  - Personal message from Optimus Prime
- **OpenTelemetry Traces**: `report_card_generation`, `report_card_requested`

### 3. PDF Export
- Report card converted to professional PDF
- Downloadable for parents and teachers
- **OpenTelemetry Traces**: `report_card_pdf_generated`

### 4. Vision Analysis (http://localhost:3000/enhanced-upload)
- Child/parent uploads report card image
- **qwen2.5-vl vision model** analyzes the image:
  - Extracts student name, grades, scores
  - Identifies strengths and weaknesses
  - Detects character virtues from teacher comments
  - Recognizes achievements
- **OpenTelemetry Traces**: `report_card_uploaded`, `report_card_analyzed`

### 5. Chain-of-Thought Evaluation
- Optimus Prime evaluates with deep reasoning:
  - **Academic Analysis**: Examines grades and learning patterns
  - **Character Assessment**: Evaluates virtues demonstrated
  - **Growth Opportunities**: Identifies improvement areas
  - **Strengths Recognition**: Celebrates accomplishments
- Final evaluation includes:
  - Overall grade (excellent/good/average/needs improvement)
  - Virtues mastered
  - Specific areas to focus on
  - Encouragement and motivation
  - 3-5 actionable pieces of advice
  - Special reward unlocked
- **OpenTelemetry Traces**: `evaluation_with_reasoning`, `evaluation_started`, `evaluation_completed`

### 6. Child Response
- Child responds to Optimus' feedback
- Shows excitement about reward and advice
- Conversation continues with enhanced context

## üìä OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

### Automatic Metrics Collected
- **Event Loop**: utilization, delay (min/max/mean/p50/p90/p99)
- **Memory**: heap usage by space (new, old, code, large object, etc.)
- **Garbage Collection**: duration by type (minor, major, incremental)
- **HTTP**: request duration, status codes, routes

### Custom Events
- `session_start`: User session begins
- `message_sent`: Child sends message to Optimus
- `virtue_detected`: Character virtue recognized in conversation
- `reward_view` / `reward_click`: Engagement with rewards
- `premium_view` / `premium_click`: Premium content interaction
- `report_card_requested`: Parent requests report card
- `report_card_generated`: Report card AI generation complete
- `report_card_pdf_generated`: PDF export complete
- `report_card_uploaded`: Image uploaded for vision analysis
- `report_card_analyzed`: Vision analysis complete
- `report_card_evaluation_started`: Chain-of-thought evaluation begins
- `report_card_evaluation_completed`: Evaluation with reasoning complete

### Trace Structure
Every API call creates a span with:
- Operation name (e.g., `POST /api/vision/analyze-report-card`)
- Duration in milliseconds
- Status (OK, ERROR)
- Attributes (student_name, performance_level, virtues_detected, etc.)
- Exception details if errors occur
