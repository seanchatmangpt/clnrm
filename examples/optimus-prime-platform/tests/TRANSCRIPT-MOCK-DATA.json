I also remind myself that my struggles serve a greater purpose - protecting others and making the world better.

  "chainOfThoughtEvaluation": {
    "reasoning": {
      "academicAnalysis": "Looking at Michael's performance, I see a student with an overall score of 68/100, which places him below the traditional \"average\" threshold. However, this single number tells only part of the story. His academic struggles are concentrated in reading comprehension and test-taking, reflected in his Wisdom score of 58. These are significant challenges that require targeted support. What's encouraging is that these difficulties appear to be affecting his confidence more than his actual capabilities - his problem-solving skills, evidenced by his success in helping peers, suggest strong cognitive abilities that aren't fully captured by traditional assessments. The test anxiety he experiences is creating a barrier between his potential and his performance.",
      "characterAssessment": "Michael's character development is exceptional and represents his true strength. His Compassion score of 90 and Teamwork score of 88 demonstrate a student who prioritizes others' wellbeing and success. The fact that he actively helps struggling classmates while facing his own academic challenges shows remarkable emotional maturity and selflessness. His Honesty score of 82 reflects a student brave enough to admit when he doesn't understand - a virtue many adults struggle with. His Courage score of 75, while not his highest, is particularly meaningful given his test anxiety; continuing to face assessments despite fear demonstrates real bravery. These character virtues - compassion, honesty, courage, and teamwork - are the foundation upon which all future success will be built.",
      "growthOpportunities": "Michael needs targeted interventions in three key areas. First, reading comprehension support should focus on building confidence alongside skills - perhaps through peer tutoring where he can both teach and learn. Second, test anxiety management through mindfulness techniques, practice tests in low-stakes environments, and reframing tests as opportunities rather than threats. Third, helping Michael recognize that his struggles don't define his intelligence; his problem-solving abilities and emotional intelligence are forms of wisdom that standardized tests fail to measure. These interventions should emphasize his strengths while addressing gaps, ensuring he doesn't internalize a narrative of academic inadequacy.",
      "strengthsRecognition": "Michael's greatest strength is his heart. In an educational system that often prizes individual achievement, he has chosen to lift others even when struggling himself. This is the mark of true leadership. His persistence in facing challenges he finds difficult shows character that cannot be taught. His honesty about his struggles demonstrates self-awareness that many adults lack. His problem-solving skills, evident in his ability to help peers, reveal cognitive abilities that may not shine in traditional assessments but are invaluable in real-world applications. Most importantly, his compassion creates a classroom environment where others feel supported - an immeasurable contribution that makes everyone's learning better."
