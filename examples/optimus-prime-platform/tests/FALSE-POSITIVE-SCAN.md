**Scanner**: Automated False Positive Hunter
**Focus**: Image upload functionality ONLY

## üîç Current Claims Under Investigation

### Claim 1: "Vision API works in browser environments"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNTESTED - POTENTIAL FALSE POSITIVE**

**Evidence Analyzed**:
- API code exists at `src/app/api/vision/analyze-report-card/route.ts`
- Client component exists at `src/components/prompt-input-upload.tsx`
- Node.js tests skip this validation

**Critical Question**: Has this been tested in an ACTUAL browser?
**Answer**: **NO** - Only assumed based on "Node.js limitation" reasoning

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH** - This could be a complete false positive

---

### Claim 2: "FormData works correctly in browser"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASSUMPTION - NOT VALIDATED**

**Evidence Analyzed**:
- Code follows browser FormData patterns
- Matches Next.js documentation examples
- Client code at `src/components/prompt-input-upload.tsx:90-98`

**Critical Question**: Has real browser testing been performed?
**Answer**: **NO** - Only inferred from code inspection

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Could fail in actual browser

---

### Claim 3: "Vision model (qwen2.5-vl) analyzes images correctly"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMPLETELY UNTESTED**

**Evidence Analyzed**:
- Model is installed (verified via `ollama list`)
- API code calls the model
- BUT: No test with actual image data

**Critical Question**: Does the vision model actually extract text from report cards?
**Answer**: **UNKNOWN** - Never tested with real image

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Core functionality unproven

---

### Claim 4: "AI components trigger upload"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT VERIFIED**

**Evidence Analyzed**:
- Client component has upload button at line 279-285
- Upload function `analyzeReportCard()` at line 75
- BUT: No test of actual interaction flow

**Critical Question**: Does clicking the button actually trigger the upload?
**Answer**: **UNKNOWN** - UI interaction never tested

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - User-facing feature unproven

---

### Claim 5: "Streaming response works for vision analysis"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNTESTED**

**Evidence Analyzed**:
- Code implements NDJSON streaming
- Response handling at `prompt-input-upload.tsx:105-133`
- BUT: Never tested end-to-end

**Critical Question**: Does the stream actually deliver data to the UI?
**Answer**: **UNKNOWN** - Stream consumption never verified

**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM** - Streaming might fail silently

---

### Claim 6: "Chain-of-thought evaluation works with vision data"
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNTESTED WITH REAL IMAGES**

**Evidence Analyzed**:
- Evaluation API exists at `/api/vision/evaluate-with-reasoning`
- Tested with mock JSON data (not from real vision analysis)
- Integration point at line 136-139

**Critical Question**: Does real vision data flow into evaluation?
**Answer**: **UNKNOWN** - Only tested with fabricated data

**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM** - Integration untested

---

## üìä False Positive Risk Assessment

### Summary
- **Claims Tested**: 0/6 (0%)
- **Claims Untested**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Claims Verified with Browser**: 0

### Risk Categories
- üî¥ **CRITICAL (4)**: Vision API, FormData, Vision Model, UI Trigger
- üü° **MEDIUM (2)**: Streaming, Chain-of-thought Integration

## üö® Critical False Positive Findings

### Finding 1: No Browser Testing Performed
**Severity**: CRITICAL

All claims about "works in browser" are **inferences** based on:
1. Code matching documentation patterns
2. Assumptions about browser vs Node.js behavior
3. NO actual browser execution

**Recommendation**: MANDATORY Playwright browser testing

---

### Finding 2: Vision Model Never Tested
**Severity**: CRITICAL

The qwen2.5-vl model has NEVER been tested with:
- Real report card images
- Any image data (only checked if installed)
- Actual OCR/text extraction

**This is a complete unknown.**

**Recommendation**: Test with real images in Playwright

---

### Finding 3: End-to-End Flow Never Validated
**Severity**: CRITICAL

The complete user journey has NEVER been tested:
1. User uploads image ‚Üí UNTESTED
2. FormData sent to API ‚Üí UNTESTED
3. Vision model processes ‚Üí UNTESTED
4. Stream returns to UI ‚Üí UNTESTED
5. UI displays results ‚Üí UNTESTED
6. Evaluation triggers ‚Üí UNTESTED

**We have 0% confidence this works.**

**Recommendation**: Full Playwright E2E test required

---

## üéØ Required Testing to Eliminate False Positives

### Test 1: Browser FormData Upload (MANDATORY)
```
GIVEN: A real browser (Playwright)
WHEN: User selects an image file
AND: Clicks "Analyze with Vision AI"
THEN: FormData should be sent to API
AND: No FormData boundary errors
AND: Image data reaches the server
```

### Test 2: Vision Model Image Analysis (MANDATORY)
```
GIVEN: A real report card image
WHEN: Vision API processes the image
THEN: Text should be extracted
AND: Grades should be parsed
AND: Student name should be detected
AND: Response should match schema
```

### Test 3: UI Streaming Display (MANDATORY)
```
GIVEN: Vision API returns streaming NDJSON
WHEN: UI receives the stream
THEN: Analysis should appear in UI
AND: Optimus response should update
AND: Chain-of-thought should trigger
AND: All data should display correctly
```

### Test 4: Full E2E User Flow (MANDATORY)
```
GIVEN: A real browser with the app running
WHEN: User completes full workflow
THEN: Every claim should be validated
AND: No assumptions remain
AND: No false positives exist
```

## üî¨ London TDD Strategy Required

### Why London TDD?
- **Mock all external dependencies** (Ollama, file system)
- **Test behavior, not implementation**
- **Verify collaborator interactions**
- **Catch integration failures early**

### Mocking Strategy for Upload Testing

1. **Mock Ollama Vision Model**
   - Stub `streamObject()` calls
   - Return controlled vision analysis data
   - Verify correct image data passed

2. **Mock FormData Processing**
   - Verify FormData construction
   - Verify correct headers
   - Verify file appended correctly

3. **Mock Streaming Response**
   - Control NDJSON stream
   - Verify UI consumes stream correctly
   - Test partial updates

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Test with REAL browser (Playwright)
   - Test with REAL images
   - Test with REAL vision model
   - NO mocks in integration layer

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conclusion: HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RISK

**Current State**: Nearly 100% of vision upload claims are UNTESTED

**Risk**: We may have built a feature that doesn't work at all

**Action Required**: IMMEDIATE comprehensive Playwright testing

**Confidence in Current Claims**: ~5%
**Confidence After Playwright Testing**: TBD

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy 8-agent London TDD swarm
2. Create Playwright test environment
3. Test with REAL browser
4. Test with REAL images
5. Validate EVERY claim
6. Update documentation with ACTUAL results
