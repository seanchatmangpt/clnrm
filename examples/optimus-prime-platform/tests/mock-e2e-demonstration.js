    content: `Greetings, young Michael. I recognize the courage it takes to face a challenge head-on, especially one that feels difficult. Reading comprehension is like decoding ancient Cybertronian texts - it requires patience and practice. The fact that you tried hard shows the spark of a true warrior.

You demonstrated both wisdom and leadership by sharing your problem-solving skills. This is the mark of a future leader - one who lifts others up rather than standing alone. Your friend is fortunate to have you by their side.`,

    content: `Listen well, young one. Intelligence is not measured by a single test or moment of anxiety. Even I, leader of the Autobots, have faced moments of doubt before great battles. What you call "test anxiety" is simply your mind preparing for challenge - it shows you care about doing well. True wisdom lies not in never feeling fear, but in facing it anyway. Your persistence and willingness to keep trying despite difficulty shows greater strength than any test score ever could. You ARE smart, Michael - and your courage in continuing forward proves it.`,

In the war for Cybertron, it was not the strongest or fastest who prevailed - it was those who refused to give up. Your teacher sees in you what I see: the spark of an Autobot who will overcome any obstacle through sheer determination. This quality will serve you far better than natural talent alone. Celebrate this growth, for it is the foundation upon which all great achievements are built.`,

Second, I am not alone - my team supports me, just as your teachers and friends support you. Third, each difficulty I overcome makes me stronger for the next challenge. I also remind myself that my struggles serve a greater purpose - protecting others and making the world better. When you struggle with reading or tests, remember you are training your mind to help others someday. Your persistence today builds the hero you will become tomorrow. This is how Autobots transform difficulty into strength.`,

// Mock chain-of-thought evaluation
const mockEvaluation = {
  reasoning: {
    academicAnalysis: `Looking at Michael's performance, I see a student with an overall score of 68/100, which places him below the traditional "average" threshold. However, this single number tells only part of the story. His academic struggles are concentrated in reading comprehension and test-taking, reflected in his Wisdom score of 58. These are significant challenges that require targeted support. What's encouraging is that these difficulties appear to be affecting his confidence more than his actual capabilities - his problem-solving skills, evidenced by his success in helping peers, suggest strong cognitive abilities that aren't fully captured by traditional assessments. The test anxiety he experiences is creating a barrier between his potential and his performance.`,

    characterAssessment: `Michael's character development is exceptional and represents his true strength. His Compassion score of 90 and Teamwork score of 88 demonstrate a student who prioritizes others' wellbeing and success. The fact that he actively helps struggling classmates while facing his own academic challenges shows remarkable emotional maturity and selflessness. His Honesty score of 82 reflects a student brave enough to admit when he doesn't understand - a virtue many adults struggle with. His Courage score of 75, while not his highest, is particularly meaningful given his test anxiety; continuing to face assessments despite fear demonstrates real bravery. These character virtues - compassion, honesty, courage, and teamwork - are the foundation upon which all future success will be built.`,

    growthOpportunities: `Michael needs targeted interventions in three key areas. First, reading comprehension support should focus on building confidence alongside skills - perhaps through peer tutoring where he can both teach and learn. Second, test anxiety management through mindfulness techniques, practice tests in low-stakes environments, and reframing tests as opportunities rather than threats. Third, helping Michael recognize that his struggles don't define his intelligence; his problem-solving abilities and emotional intelligence are forms of wisdom that standardized tests fail to measure. These interventions should emphasize his strengths while addressing gaps, ensuring he doesn't internalize a narrative of academic inadequacy.`,

    strengthsRecognition: `Michael's greatest strength is his heart. In an educational system that often prizes individual achievement, he has chosen to lift others even when struggling himself. This is the mark of true leadership. His persistence in facing challenges he finds difficult shows character that cannot be taught. His honesty about his struggles demonstrates self-awareness that many adults lack. His problem-solving skills, evident in his ability to help peers, reveal cognitive abilities that may not shine in traditional assessments but are invaluable in real-world applications. Most importantly, his compassion creates a classroom environment where others feel supported - an immeasurable contribution that makes everyone's learning better.`,

    encouragement: `Michael, you possess something far more valuable than perfect test scores - you have a heart that seeks to help others and the courage to keep trying when things are hard. The struggles you face with reading and test anxiety are temporary obstacles that can be overcome with support and practice. Your compassion, teamwork, and persistence are permanent gifts that will serve you throughout your life. Many brilliant people struggled academically before finding their path to success. Your willingness to help others while facing your own challenges shows a maturity and strength that most adults never achieve.`,

      'Practice reading comprehension with materials you enjoy - choose topics that interest you to build confidence alongside skills',

      'Keep a "success journal" where you write down one thing you did well each day, academic or otherwise, to build confidence',
      'Consider tutoring younger students in problem solving - teaching others reinforces your own learning and showcases your strengths',

// Mock child response
const mockChildResponse = `Wow, thank you so much Optimus! The Heart of an Autobot Badge sounds amazing! I really like the idea of keeping a success journal and maybe tutoring younger kids - that makes me feel like my problem-solving skills really matter.

Can I really be a good student even if reading is hard for me?`;
