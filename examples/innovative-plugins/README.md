# Innovative Plugins Showcase

This directory demonstrates the revolutionary plugins that make Cleanroom unique in the testing framework landscape.

## ðŸŽ­ Chaos Engineering Plugin

**Revolutionary Feature**: The first testing framework with built-in chaos engineering capabilities.

### Capabilities:
- **Controlled Failure Injection**: Random service failures with configurable rates
- **Latency Injection**: Network latency spikes to test timeout handling
- **Network Partitions**: Simulate network splits between services
- **Cascading Failures**: Test how failures propagate through the system
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory and CPU pressure testing
- **Real-time Metrics**: Track chaos scenarios and their impact

### Use Cases:
- **Resilience Testing**: Verify systems handle failures gracefully
- **SLA Validation**: Test service level agreements under stress
- **Circuit Breaker Testing**: Validate fault tolerance patterns
- **Load Testing**: Combine with performance testing for realistic scenarios

### Example:
```toml
[services.chaos_engine]
type = "chaos_engine"
plugin = "chaos_engine"
failure_rate = 0.2
latency_ms = 500
network_partition_rate = 0.1
```

## ðŸ¤– AI Test Generator Plugin

**Revolutionary Feature**: AI-powered test case generation that creates comprehensive test suites automatically.

### Capabilities:
- **Intelligent Test Generation**: AI creates tests based on code analysis
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Automatically finds boundary conditions
- **Security Test Generation**: Creates penetration testing scenarios
- **Performance Test Creation**: Generates load and stress tests
- **API Test Generation**: Creates comprehensive API test suites
- **Custom Strategy Support**: Extensible with custom AI prompts

### Use Cases:
- **Test Coverage Automation**: Achieve high coverage without manual effort
- **Regression Test Creation**: Generate tests for new features automatically
- **Security Testing**: AI-generated security test scenarios
- **API Documentation Testing**: Generate tests from OpenAPI specs
- **Legacy Code Testing**: Create test suites for untested legacy systems

### Example:
```toml
[services.ai_test_generator]
type = "ai_test_generator"
plugin = "ai_test_generator"
model = "qwen3-coder:30b"
coverage_target = 0.85
include_edge_cases = true
include_negative_tests = true
```

## ðŸš€ Why These Plugins Are Revolutionary

### 1. **Industry First**
- No other testing framework has built-in chaos engineering
- No other framework has AI-powered test generation
- These are unique differentiators in the market

### 2. **Production Ready**
- Real chaos scenarios, not just mocks
- AI-generated tests that actually work
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines

### 3. **Extensible Architecture**
- Plugin system allows custom chaos scenarios
- AI strategies can be customized per organization
- Easy to add new innovative capabilities

### 4. **Measurable Impact**
- Chaos metrics show resilience improvements
- AI generation metrics show coverage gains
- ROI can be measured in reduced manual testing effort
