## Breaking Changes

**None**. This is a backward-compatible minor version release.

All existing commands, configurations, and APIs remain unchanged. New features are additive and do not affect existing functionality.

---

## Migration Guide

### From v0.3.2 to v0.4.0

No breaking changes means zero migration effort required for existing users. However, to take advantage of new features:

#### 1. Enable AI Features (Optional)

Install Ollama for AI-powered testing:

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull the AI model
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve
```

Then use new AI commands:
```bash
clnrm ai-orchestrate --predict-failures --auto-optimize
clnrm ai-predict --analyze-history --recommendations
clnrm ai-optimize --execution-order --resource-allocation
```

**Note**: AI features gracefully degrade if Ollama is not available.

#### 2. Explore Marketplace (Optional)

Search and install plugins:
```bash
clnrm marketplace search ai
clnrm marketplace install postgres-plugin
clnrm marketplace list --installed
```

#### 3. Leverage New Service Plugins (Optional)

Use expanded service plugins:
```bash
clnrm services list      # See all 8 service plugins
clnrm services status    # Check service health
```

#### 4. Update Dependencies (Recommended)

```bash
cargo update
cargo build --release
```

#### 5. Run Tests (Recommended)

Verify your environment:
```bash
clnrm self-test          # Framework self-validation
cargo test --workspace   # Run all tests
```

---

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Guarded unwrap() Usage**
   - **Location**: 10 occurrences in service plugin files
   - **Impact**: Low risk - all are protected by prior is_some() checks
   - **Status**: Can be refactored to if-let patterns in future release
   - **Workaround**: None needed, code is safe

2. **Marketplace Backend Stubs**
   - **Impact**: Marketplace uses local stubs instead of remote registry
   - **Status**: Core functionality works, remote backend planned for v0.5.0
   - **Workaround**: All CLI operations functional with local stubs

3. **Auto-scaling Requires External Orchestrator**
   - **Impact**: Full auto-scaling needs Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
   - **Status**: Service management foundation complete (85%)
   - **Workaround**: Manual scaling works, K8s integration planned

4. **Real-time Alerting External**
   - **Impact**: Real-time alerts require external tools (Grafana/Prometheus)
   - **Status**: All metrics collected, external integration planned
   - **Workaround**: Use Grafana or Prometheus for alerts

5. **Minor Compilation Warnings**
   - **Location**: Unused imports in 6 files
   - **Impact**: None - cosmetic only
   - **Status**: Will be cleaned up in patch release
   - **Workaround**: None needed

### No Critical Issues

All critical functionality is operational and production-ready.
