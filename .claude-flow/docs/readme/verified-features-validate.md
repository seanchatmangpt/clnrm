## üìä VERIFICATION SUMMARY

| Feature | Status | Verification Command | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| CLI Basic | ‚úÖ Working | `./target/release/clnrm --help` | All basic commands work |
| Service Plugins | ‚úÖ Working | `./target/release/clnrm plugins` | 2 plugins available |
| Self-Testing | üöß Partial | `./target/release/clnrm self-test` | 4/5 tests pass |
| TOML Config | ‚ùå Broken | `./target/release/clnrm validate file.toml` | Parser issues |

| Build System | ‚úÖ Working | `cargo build --release` | Compiles successfully |

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

Create an honest README that:
1. **Leads with current status** - Be upfront about development phase
2. **Documents what works** - Focus on verified functionality
3. **Acknowledges limitations** - Clear about what doesn't work yet
4. **Provides roadmap** - Show direction and progress
5. **Includes verification** - Every claim has a test command
6. **Avoids false positives** - Better to under-promise than over-promise

This approach builds trust through honesty and provides a solid foundation for future development.
