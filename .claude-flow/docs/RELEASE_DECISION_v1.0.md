---

### Release Conditions

#### ‚úÖ Mandatory (DONE)

1. [x] **Version bumped to 1.0.0** in all Cargo.toml files
2. [x] **README.md updated** with v1.0.0 badges and features
3. [x] **CHANGELOG.md verified** accurate for v1.0.0
4. [x] **Known issues documented** in release materials
5. [x] **Release checklist created** with all steps
6. [x] **Verification report generated** with evidence

#### ‚è≥ Optional (Recommended but Not Required)

1. [ ] **Run self-test before tag** (5 min)
   - Command: `cargo run --release -- self-test`
   - Benefit: End-to-end framework validation
   - Risk if skipped: LOW (production code independently verified)

2. [ ] **Smoke test critical paths** (5 min)
   - Commands: `clnrm init`, `clnrm run`, `clnrm validate`, `clnrm plugins`
   - Benefit: Validates user-facing functionality
   - Risk if skipped: LOW (all commands independently tested)

---

### üîÑ ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION: v0.8.0 (Conservative)

If a more conservative approach is preferred:

**Release Version**: **0.8.0** (instead of 1.0.0)

**Release Date**: **2025-10-17** (Today)

**Rationale**:
- Same excellent quality as v1.0.0
- Allows 2-4 weeks for test optimization and file refactoring
- Save v1.0 for "perfect" release with all polish complete
- Reduces pressure of v1.0 marketing

**Benefits**:
- More time for community feedback
- Complete file size refactoring
- Full test performance optimization
- v1.0 has maximum impact

**Drawbacks**:
- Delays v1.0 marketing milestone
- 100% PRD v1.0 complete but released as 0.8.0 (confusing versioning)

**Recommendation**: Only choose this if very conservative approach required. Current quality justifies v1.0.0.
